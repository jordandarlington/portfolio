# Software Engineer

I’m a full-stack software engineer. Alongside product work, I focus heavily on DevOps and developer tooling - building CI/CD pipelines, GitHub Apps, and Actions to improve developer experience and efficiency.

I enjoy tackling complex problems end-to-end, from designing features to optimising workflows and automating processes. I’m driven by building scalable systems and effective tools that help both products and teams perform at their best.
